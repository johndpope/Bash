<p align="center"> A temporary email right from your terminal written in POSIX sh</p><br>

<img src="images/demo.gif" align="right"> `tmpmail` is a command line utility written in POSIX `sh` that allows you to create a temporary email address
and receive emails to the temporary email address. It uses 1secmail's [API](https://www.1secmail.com/api/)
to receive emails.

By default, emails will be generated by random unless the `--generate` argument is followed by the desired email address.

By default `w3m` is used to render the HTML emails on the terminal.
But if you prefer another text based web browser or would rather view the email in a GUI web browser such as Firefox, simply
use the `--browser` argument followed by the command needed to launch the web browser of your choice.
