# You are awesome!

You've finished all of the exercises! That means you are awesome!

You learned what Bash is and how to write your first script. But, to be honest, that doesn't mean that you completely mastered Bash. There are a lot of other things you still have to learn.

Here's a small list of other literature covering Bash:

* [bash-handbook](https://github.com/denysdovhan/bash-handbook) is a handbook which was used to build this workshopper.
* Bash man page. In many environments that you can run Bash, the help system `man` can display information about Bash, by running the command `man bash`.
* ["Bourne-Again SHell manual"](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/) in many formats, including HTML, Info, TeX, PDF, and Texinfo.  Hosted at <https://www.gnu.org/>. As of 2016/01, this covers version 4.3, last updated 2015/02/02.
* [Bash 3.2 Man page](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/bash.1.html) hosted at Apple's Mac Developer Library site. As of 2016/01, this covers version 3.2, last updated 2006/09/28.
