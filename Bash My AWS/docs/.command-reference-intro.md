title: Bash-my-AWS Command Reference
description: Command reference for Bash-my-AWS - CLI Tools for AWS.
    Bash-my-AWS provides short memorable commands for managing resources
    in Amazon Web Services.

Bash-my-AWS provides over 120 commands for managing AWS Resources but fear not!

Effort has been put into making them *discoverable*, *memorable* and hopefully in most
cases *obvious*.

The reference material below is all extracted from the source of the commands.

Lists in this project are alphabetised except where it makes sense not to.
The first few sets of commands were chosen because they are likely to be of
the most interest to readers.

!!! Note "General Rules"
    - Commands expect `$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable to be set
      (check/set with `region` command)
    - Most commands that list resources (`stacks`, `instances , etc)
      accept filter term as first arg.
        - *e.g. `stacks blah` is equivalent to `stacks | grep blah`*
    - Most commands accept resource identifiers via STDIN
      (first token of each line)
    - Resources are generally listed in chronological order of creation.
